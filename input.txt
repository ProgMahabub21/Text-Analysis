Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
Satoshi Nakamoto

www.bitcoin.org
Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
1. Introduction
Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as
trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for
most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The
system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes.

2. Transactions
We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the
next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of
ownership.
The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend
the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every
transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to
issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent.
The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the
company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.
We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier
transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care
about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to
be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and
decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be
publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the
order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the
majority of nodes agreed it was the first received.
3. Timestamp Server
The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a
hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a
newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the
time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in
its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

4. Proof-of-Work
To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.
The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the
hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number
of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.
For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the
block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU
effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed
without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block
would include redoing all the blocks after it.
The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision
making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone
able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority
decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.
To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,
the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of
blocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.
5. Network
The steps to run the network are as follows:
1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the
chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.
Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on
extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some
nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,
but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other
branch will then switch to the longer one.

New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reach
many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped
messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and
realizes it missed one.
6. Incentive
By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.
The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending
resources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation
free.
The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
7. Reclaiming Disk Space
Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.
A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
memory.

8. Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch
linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for
himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,
and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.
As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more
vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
9. Combining and Splitting Value
Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a
separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined,
transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input
from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two
outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.
It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those
transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a
complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.

10. Privacy
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the
parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending
an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is
similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of
individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them
from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input
transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk
is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.
11. Calculations
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest
chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.
The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial
Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its
lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the
gap by -1.
The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's
Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an
infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever
reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:
p = probability an honest node finds the next block
q = probability the attacker finds the next block
qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind
qz={

q/ p
z
if pq}
6
Identities Transactions Trusted
Third Party Counterparty Public
Identities Transactions Public
New Privacy Model
Traditional Privacy Model
Given our assumption that p > q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the
attacker has to catch up with increases. With the odds against him, if he doesn't make a lucky
lunge forward early on, his chances become vanishingly small as he falls further behind.
We now consider how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being
sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction. We assume the sender is an attacker
who wants to make the recipient believe he paid him for a while, then switch it to pay back to
himself after some time has passed. The receiver will be alerted when that happens, but the
sender hopes it will be too late.
The receiver generates a new key pair and gives the public key to the sender shortly before
signing. This prevents the sender from preparing a chain of blocks ahead of time by working on
it continuously until he is lucky enough to get far enough ahead, then executing the transaction at
that moment. Once the transaction is sent, the dishonest sender starts working in secret on a
parallel chain containing an alternate version of his transaction.
The recipient waits until the transaction has been added to a block and z blocks have been
linked after it. He doesn't know the exact amount of progress the attacker has made, but
assuming the honest blocks took the average expected time per block, the attacker's potential
progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:
=z
q
p
To get the probability the attacker could still catch up now, we multiply the Poisson density for
each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:

12. Conclusion
We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with
the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power. The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.

One popular notion, largely unsubstantiated and unchallenged, isthat the cost of bitcoin creation provides a support level below which this cryptocurrency’s price shouldnever fall because if it did, mining would become unprofitable and threaten the maintenance ofbitcoin’s public ledger (Garcia et al., 2014). A related belief is that bitcoin’s price must rise with anincrease in the cost of production (e.g., mining expenses). Other research has used mining costs toexplain or forecast bitcoin’s price (Meynkhard, 2019; Hayes, 2019). Kristofek (2020) and Fantazzini &Kolodin (2020) employ econometric analyses to debunk this theory, showing that changes in miningcosts follow changes in bitcoin’s price rather than preceding them, but the reason for this behaviorremains unexplained in these analyses.This research aims to employ economic theory to explain why econometric studies have failed to predictbitcoin prices and why mining costs follow movements in bitcoin prices rather than precede them. Westart with a review of prior research into the causes of bitcoin prices changes, followed by an economicexplanation for its unpredictability. Finally, we explain the chain of causality connecting a bitcoin’s priceto its mining costs.Review of the LiteratureEconomic Factors and the Bitcoin’s PriceForeign exchange pricing analyses often employ models based on the quantity theory of money (QTM)or purchasing power parity (PPP). These models are of little use with bitcoin because, currently, bitcoinis not a widespread unit of account or medium of exchange (Baur et al., 2018). Although somecompanies accept bitcoins, far fewer price their products and services in this cryptocurrency. Instead,they use the fiat currencies of their economic regions, such as dollars or euros, to price their sales items.If they accept bitcoin, customers convert these prices according to the spot exchange rate (i.e., bitcoin’sprice). As a result, it is impossible to create a price index for bitcoin similar to the consumer price indexor implicit price index that exists for dollar-denominated products consumed or produced in the UnitedStates or for goods and services denominated in the local currency of any other country. The QTM andPPP models rely on such indices or substitutes for them, but none appear to be reliable for bitcoin.Nevertheless, there are valid reasons to expect bitcoin’s price to react to changes in economic andfinancial conditions. For example, increases in a nation’s inflation rate relative to other countries orhyperinflation in any nation, all else being equal, should increase the demand for alternatives, such asbitcoin, and appreciate its price relative to the inflation-prone currencies. Table 1 identifies some of themost important studies addressing the impact of economic and financial variables on bitcoin’s price.Except for a few tested variables, their results have not been robust.

Most of them, such as the number of transactions per period and number ofaddresses, act as proxies for the breadth and depth of the bitcoin market. As more individuals andbusiness leaders become aware of and comfortable with the existence and potential worth of acryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, the demand increases, causing its exchange rate value to appreciate.Other ecosystem research seeks to determine how the mining ecosystem affects bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin’s hash rate, the total number of coins in circulation, the cost of mining, and the rate at whichminers create new coins are all potential factors. Bitcoin’s algorithm adjusts the difficulty of mining sothat miners create new coins at a constant rate for approximately four years. Every 210,000 blocks, thealgorithm reduces by half the rate of new coin issuance, an event that some researchers have perceivedto be a mining-cost shock that should reduce the flow of bitcoin supplied to the currency markets.

As the bitcoin’s price rises, socialmedia and traditional news outlets broadcast stories about its upward trend, increasing interest,awareness, and fears of missing out (FOMO) on the potential returns of investing in the currency. Whenprices start to fall, stories about bitcoin’s intrinsic lack of value and absence of backing can create near-panic selloffs. Autoregressive models and models tracking sentiment capture these feedbackmechanisms very well. Table 3 references several representative articles that focus on or capture thepsychological feedback mechanisms in the bitcoin market. For autoregressive integrative movingaverage (ARIMA) studies, we indicate whether the models are useful in predicting bitcoin’s future value.

Attempts to resolve these differences have includedseparating bitcoin’s history into two or more periods (Ciaian, 2016; Li & Wang, 2017), distinguishingbetween short-term and long-term impacts (Bouoiyour et al., 2015; Ciaian et al., 2016; Kristoufek, 2015;Li & Wang, 2017), and considering nonlinear formulations (Balcilar et al., 2017).Relatively recently, machine-learning models, such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Quadratic DiscriminantAnalysis, Support Vector Machine and Long Short-term Memory, Recurrent Neural Network, and ParticleSwarm Optimization, have been employed to predict the prices of cryptocurrencies, in general, andbitcoin, in particular. While the short-term results seem to be more robust than statistical models andanalyses, machine-learning models for predicting long-term bitcoin exchange rates are still ratherinaccurate (Chen et al., 2020, Indera et al., 2017, Rathan et al., 2019, and Velankar et al., 2018).Econometric work has also been done to determine if bitcoin is a hedge, diversifier, or safe-havencurrency, but these analyses have focused more on correlation than causation (Bouri et al., 2017).Bitcoin Price ManipulationThe Bank for International Settlements (2019) reports that the daily turnover of fiat currencies exceeded$6.6 trillion. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence that manipulation of some fiat currencies has beenwidespread, driven in large part by the actions of governments and their central banks (Gagnon, 2012;Bergsten, 2013) – particularly those trying to fix their exchange rates to a dominant foreign currency.Despite the depth of these markets, speculative attacks on fiat currencies have also occurred (Buiter,1987; Grilli, 1986), and investors have learned how to profit from currency manipulation (Liss, 2007).Any currency that lacks liquidity is subject to manipulation, which is why cryptocurrencies have comeunder particular scrutiny. Manipulating bitcoin’s price should require fewer resources than a dominantfiat currency because daily turnover is relatively low, and no central bank exists to protect it. Peterson(2021) concludes, with confidence greater than or equal to 95%, that illicit activity manipulated bitcoin’sprice in 2013, 2018, and 2019. Hu et al. (2020) analyzed intraday orders and trades and found significant

6 | P a g eApril 27, 2022evidence of bitcoin price manipulation during this cryptocurrency’s price bubble in late 2017. Griffin andShams (2020) claim that backers of the Tether stablecoin acted to manipulate bitcoin’s price by issuingTether without adequate backing, thereby inflating bitcoin’s price. Wei (2018) finds, to the contrary,that Tether issuances had no impact on bitcoin returns.Supply and Demand AnalysisIn competitive markets, prices are determined by the flow forces of supply and demand (Cecchetti andSchoenholtz, 2020; Marthinsen, 2020). The equilibrium exchange rate is at the intersection of adownward-sloping demand and upward-sloping supply. Like any freely fluctuating currency, bitcoin’sprice is measured by the cost to purchase it in fiat currencies, altcoins, or precious metals, and it isdetermined by the flow of supply and demand forces per period. Participants in the dollar-bitcoinmarket are, potentially, identical to those in the dollar-euro market, but their participation levels andscale of involvement are markedly different. The vast majority of bitcoin buyers are investors andspeculators, who are incentivized mainly by changes in returns and fluctuations in expected risks andreturns. Currently, the demand for bitcoins (by dollar holders) is very price inelastic because: Very few products are valued in bitcoins. Therefore, dollar holders have little or no reason toconvert dollars to bitcoins to buy bitcoin-denominated goods or services. Those that convertdollars to bitcoins to buy goods and services do so to pay individuals and businesses that willaccept them; A paltry volume of dollars is converted into bitcoins for bitcoin-denominated aid or gifts; Individuals may convert dollars to bitcoins for investment and speculative reasons, but typically,for financial investments, they do so based on expected changes in bitcoin’s price; No government (yet) is a substantial source of bitcoin demand,3 and No central bank (yet) fixes its exchange rate relative to bitcoin or is interested in stabilizingbitcoin’s price (i.e., exchange rate in terms of a fiat currency or altcoin).The significant sources of bitcoin’s supply are distinctively different from its demand and significantlydifferent from the typical supply in non-bitcoin-related foreign exchange markets. In contrast todemand, there are many reasons why bitcoin owners might want to supply bitcoins to purchase fiatcurrencies, such as dollars, euros, and yuan. For example in the dollar-bitcoin market, Anyone paid in bitcoins or receiving them in exchange might supply them to purchase dollarsand afterward purchase dollar-denominated goods and services. Furthermore, fiat currencies,such as the dollar, are trusted, relatively stable, and have vast financial networks. Some companies, albeit few, compensate their employees in bitcoins, and a growing number ofcompanies, restaurants, bars, and shops accept bitcoins. For risk management purposes, if mostof these individuals and establishments convert their bitcoins into fiat currencies, such as3 In September 2021, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender, but its total holdings amounted to fewer thanBTC2,000. El Salvador’s “official currency” is the U.S. dollar.

7 | P a g eApril 27, 2022dollars, to pay their bills, this supply source could be significant during periods when bitcoin’sprice is expected to fall. Bitcoin holders who wish to invest in dollar-related financial investments could also besignificant sources of bitcoin supply – especially those wishing to diversify their portfolios,mitigate risks, and cash out of bitcoin-denominated investments that have appreciated or areexpected to depreciate. Individuals and businesses that own bitcoins but wish to make transfers denominated in dollarsare potential (albeit likely small) sources of supply to the dollar-bitcoin market. Bitcoin has no central bank seeking to stabilize its value. The number of coins mined increases ata predetermined rate, which is currently 6.25 bitcoins per 10 minutes. Miners, who earn thenewly created bitcoins, have two main options: holding their freshly acquired bitcoins orconverting them into a fiat or altcoin currency. If they decide to hold them, the newly createdbitcoins have no direct effect on bitcoins' supply to the dollar-bitcoin exchange market. If theyconvert the bitcoins to a non-dollar currency or altcoin, the impact on bitcoins' dollar pricewould be indirect through triangular arbitrage.Concerning bitcoin’s fiat price, such as dollars per bitcoin or euros per bitcoin, the supply should beupward sloping and demand downward sloping, thereby ensuring a stable equilibrium. At the sametime, none of the dollar-bitcoin market participants (listed above) responds with alacrity to bitcoin pricechanges because so few goods and services are denominated in bitcoins, resulting in extreme priceinsensitivity. Bitcoin's price is far less critical for investors and speculators than expected price changes,which is an exogenous variable that shifts demand and supply rather than causing movements alongthese curves. Therefore, the extreme inelasticity of supply and demand, with respect to its price,guarantees that any shift in the supply of or demand for bitcoins will cause a disproportionate change inprice relative to quantity traded per period. Therefore, until the bitcoin market's depth increases, itsrole as a reliable store of value will continue to be threatened.Since its creation in 2009, fluctuations in bitcoin's dollar price have been caused almost entirely bydemand movements. To the extent these demand-related movements can be predicted, bitcoin’s futureprice might be forecastable using traditional econometric methods, but many exogenous shocks, such asearthquakes, hyperinflation, price bubbles, hacks, social sentiment, political regime changes, andexchange rate controls, are random. Nearly 80% of the bitcoins created, to date, are held by theirowners, with little or no intention to sell, which is to say the impact of demand is not on the quantity ofbitcoins created but on the quantity per period offered to the foreign exchange market. 4Relationship between Mining Costs and Bitcoin’s PriceThe dollar-bitcoin market has two characteristics of a purely competitive market, a homogeneous assetand an absence of entry or exit barriers. Anyone wishing to buy or sell bitcoins can do so via exchangesor directly using the bitcoin protocol. Whether the bitcoin market has the final two characteristics of a4 Mark DeCambre, Who owns bitcoin?

8 | P a g eApril 27, 2022purely competitive market (i.e., many buyers and sellers and perfect information) is debatable. Themarket is relatively shallow, which means a large-volume buyer or seller could significantly move themarket price. Moreover, market information is not perfect, which is why, in the early days, arbitragingprice discrepancies between exchanges had been possible. Recently, better information flows, causedby bitcoin's increased interest, have reduced or eliminated this ability.Miners in the dollar-bitcoin market are price-takers and not price-makers. As a result, they face perfectlyelastic demand curves, which means their average and marginal revenues are equal. If the averageminer earns excess profits, then new miners should enter the market and reduce or eliminate theseexcess returns (Kristofek, 2020).How Excess Profits for Miners Affects Bitcoin’s PriceOn January 28, 2022, the total estimated bitcoin hash rate was approximately 204 exahashes persecond, which equals 19,584 exahashes per bitcoin mined.5 Bitcoin’s price on that day was about$37,150, and miners were compensated at a rate of 6.25 bitcoins per 10-minute period. Given theseconditions, a miner who controlled just 1% of the total bitcoin hashing power, such as the 58COIN Pool,would expect to earn daily revenues equal to $334,350.6 With these expected revenues per day, our 1%-miner would pay his/her fixed and variable business expenses.Variable expenses include costs, such as electricity and personnel, while fixed expenses includecomputers, new and faster processing chips, and office space (Kristoufek, 2020). A profit-maximizingminer should produce to the point where the marginal cost of production equals the marginal revenue.If excess profits are earned, new miners should enter, and existing miners should be incentivized tochange their hashing capacities, depending on whether they are on the upward-sloping or downward-sloping portion of their long-term average total costs curves.For two primary reasons, the entry of miners into or exit from the bitcoin foreign exchange market doesnot influence market supply and, therefore, does not affect bitcoin's price. First, bitcoin’s total quantityincreases at a predetermined rate, set by bitcoin's mathematical algorithm, rather than the number ofminers. Currently, bitcoin’s growth rate is BTC6.25 per 10-minute interval. If changes in miners’efficiency cause this growth rate to accelerate above or decelerate below the BTC6.25 per 10-minutepace, bitcoin's algorithm automatically adjusts the difficulty level to reset the target to BTC6.25 per 10-minute interval. The second reason bitcoin’s fixed money creation has little or no effect on its fiat-currency price is because miners must offer the newly created bitcoins to the foreign exchange marketfor them to affect its price. If miners hold the newly created bitcoins, there is no direct effect on theirfiat-currency price.5 An exahash is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 (i.e., one quintrillion) hashes. (204 exahashes/second) × (60seconds/minute) × 10 minutes/block) ÷ (6.25 bitcoins/block) = 19,584 exahashes/bitcoin.6 This miner has a 1% chance of earning 6.25 bitcoins every 10 minutes and a 99% chance of earning nothing.Therefore, the expected revenue per 10-minute-interval equals [(1% × BTC6.25 × $37,150/BTC)] + (99% × BTC 0 ×$20,000/BTC)] = $2,321.88 per 10-minute interval. Because a 24-hour day can be separated into 144 ten-minutesegments, the expected daily return equals 144 x $2,321.88 = $334,350.

9 | P a g eApril 27, 2022Consider the effect that market entry has on a miner who controls 1% of the total mining capacity. -Three major scenarios are possible. Case #1: Suppose that, despite increased competition, our 1% miner defends its market share byinvesting in greater hashing power. Expected revenues would remain the same because atbitcoin’s market price and our miner's expected chances of success remain the same, but miningcosts would rise, causing profits to fall. Case #2: Suppose our 1%-miner did not invest in new hashing power, thereby incurring nofurther costs. Under these conditions, its hashing share would fall as new miners entered andexisting miners expanded capacity, causing expected revenues and profits to fall. Case #3: Finally, suppose our miner invested in greater hashing power, which increased itsmarket share. Expected revenues would rise with the increased probability of success, but theeffect on profits would be uncertain, depending on whether per unit costs rose or fell andwhether revenues rose more or less than costs. If our miner could earn excess profits, then anew wave of miners would enter the market, and existing miners would be incentivized toexpand capacity, thereby driving long-term excess gains to zero.The miner’s decision to adjust its scale of production would depend on the expected change in long-term average total costs. If they are expected to fall, the optimal strategy would be to increasemining activities. If the reverse were true, the miner would reduce its scale. Any changes in capacitythat increased excess profits would encourage more competition, which would reduce earnings inthe long run.Using the dollar as the reference fiat currency, the main take-away points from these three cases are:(1) Bitcoin's mathematical algorithm determines the rate at which the overall supply increases. Theentry and exit of miners do not affect the rate at which new bitcoins are supplied to the dollar-bitcoin market;(2) Only if newly created bitcoins are sold for dollars would they affect the dollar per bitcoinexchange rate;(3) Improvements in technology, such as a new ASIC chip that doubles a miner’s hashing power, donot affect the rate at which bitcoins are created because the bitcoin algorithm automaticallyadjusts the level of mining difficulty, thereby ensuring that no more than the predefined amountof bitcoins are created each period, and(4) Due to these forces, any excess mining profits should be driven to zero in the long run by (1) theentry of new miners and changes in existing miners’ hashing power, which reduces the expectedchances of success and (2) rising costs, fueled by the need to maintain or expand hashing marketshare. Similarly, if operating losses occur, miners would exit the market, thereby increasingsurvivors’ chances of success and reducing the demand for costly technological developmentsthat increase hashing power.(5) For exogenous shocks to the dollar-bitcoin market, the long-term effects on excess profitsshould be the same. For example, if energy costs rise, marginally profitable miners would dropout, increasing survivors' market share. As a result, their expected revenues would increasesimultaneously as their energy costs rose, thereby driving excess profits to zero.

10 | P a g eApril 27, 2022Appendix A formalizes this qualitative analysis mathematically. It shows that the average variable cost ofmining a bitcoin in a given period depends on the price and excess profits per unit in the precedingperiod. As the price rises increasing excess profits, the cost of mining one bitcoin will rise in thefollowing period assuming electricity costs remain stable. Similarly, as the price falls, decreasing excessprofits, the cost of mining one bitcoin in the subsequent period will fall.Empirical EvidenceRecent empirical studies support our conclusion that cost changes have no significant impact on bitcoinprice and follow price changes rather than the reverse. For example, Kristoufek (2020, p. 7), using acointegration and vector error correction model for data from January 2014 to July 2018, concludes,“bitcoin price drives the mining costs and not (or only weakly) the other way around.” Fantazzini &Kolodin (2020, p. 17), whose data run from August 1, 2015 to February 29, 2020, conclude, “there wasneither evidence of Granger-causality nor cointegration in the first examined sample [from August 1,2016 to December 4, 2017], ..., whereas there was evidence of unidirectional Granger-causality andcointegration in the second sample [from December 11, 2017 to February 24, 2020] ..., going from thebitcoin price to the hashrate (or to the [cost of production models]) but not vice versa.” Kjærland, et al,whose data run from January 1, 2013 to February 20, 2018, find “... the technological factor Hashrateshould not be included in modeling price dynamics or fundamental values since it does not affect Bitcoinsupply.” “[W]e believe that the causality between Bitcoin and Hashrate is such that it is the Bitcoin pricethat drives Hashrate, not the other way around. This outcome is consistent with economic theory sincean increase in price will naturally result in the increased profitability of mining.” (Kjærland, et al., 2018).Our analysis does not predict bitcoin’s price but rather uses economic theory to explain Kristoufek’s(2020), Fantazzini & Kolodin’s (2020), and Kjærland, et al.’s (2018) results. In this section, we clarify thelogic behind why causation should run from changes in bitcoin’s price to changes in the cost ofproducing bitcoins (i.e., hash rate) and not vice versa. Using data from January 3, 2017 to January 28,2022, we show how bitcoin’s hash rate adjusted to its exogenously changing price. This interval isdivided into four periods, each of which captures a rise and fall in the USD price of bitcoin. The naturalbreak between the periods can be seen most clearly by graphing the log of price as shown in Exhibit 1.The vertical bars between periods represent the low points between extended price decreases andincreases.

While both the price of abitcoin and the number of exahashes to create one have increased over the years, a cursoryexamination of these exhibits demonstrates that there is little, if any, relationship between the two, andif anything, the hash rate follows the price dynamic rather than the reverse, as found by Kjærland, et al.(2018), Fantazzini & Kolodin (2020), and Kristoufek (2020). In Period 1, the hash rate was slow to rise asthe price of bitcoin rose to a peak. 7 From December 17, 2017, to September 25, 2018, the price ofbitcoin fell by 66% but its hashrate rose by 311%. This divergence reflects miners’ reaction to the 2017price bubble, which increased profits and incentivized others to enter the market and existing miners toboost their hash rates by more fully employing existing capacity and by purchasing and installing, withsome lag, new, more efficient mining rigs. It took about nine months before bitcoin’s price drop finallyeliminated excess profits and forced miners to deactivate their least profitable rigs and reduce theirhash rates in other ways. Period 2 shows the hash rate again rising slowly, as bitcoin’s price peaked, andthen continuing to rise despite bitcoin’s price decline. Period 3 includes the bitcoin halving on May 11,2020. Because the number of bitcoins awarded every ten minutes fell from 12.5 to 6.25, the number of7 The introduction of a bitcoin futures market on December 10, 2017 did not have a significant impact on bitcoin’sprice during Bubble Period #1 but may have contributed to the decline in 2018. Empirical results are inconclusive.See Hattori and Ishida (2021) and Liu et al (2019), and Jalan et al. (2019).

This had practically no effect on the price of bitcoin,which remained steady for about five months even as the hash rate climbed. Eventually, the price ofbitcoin bubbled, rising 490% from October 8, 2020, to April 15, 2021, but the hash rate failed to followthe bubble rising by only 28%. In Period 4, the hash rate shows a continuous rise whereas bitcoin’s pricerises and falls. The correlation between bitcoin’s price and hash rate is less than 20% during this period.Exhibit 2Bitcoin Price and Hash Rate during Period #1: January 3, 2017 to December 15, 2018Exhibit 3Bitcoin Price and Hash Rate during Period #2: December 15, 2018 to March 15, 20200500100015002000250030003500$0$5,000$10,000$15,000$20,000$25,0001/3/20172/3/20173/3/20174/3/20175/3/20176/3/20177/3/20178/3/20179/3/201710/3/201711/3/201712/3/20171/3/20182/3/20183/3/20184/3/20185/3/20186/3/20187/3/20188/3/20189/3/201810/3/201811/3/201812/3/2018EH/BitcoinUSD/BitcoinUSD/Bitcoin EH/Bitcoin01000200030004000500060007000$0$2,000$4,000$6,000$8,000$10,000$12,000$14,000EH/BitcoinUSD/BitcoinUSD/Bitcoin EH/Bitcoin

14 | P a g eApril 27, 2022of exchange, and store of value means that bitcoin fails to satisfy the major functions that “money” issupposed to fulfill. Therefore, care must be taken when couching analyses in the QTM or PPP context.In contrast to its value, the price of a bitcoin can be measured easily and analyzed in the same way asforeign exchange rates. At its current level of development, bitcoin’s supply and demand are highlyinelastic. As a result, any significant exogenous shock to supply or demand, ceteris paribus, will causevolatile movements in price, thereby reducing bitcoin’s chances of acting as a meaningful and reliablestore of value.Finally, bitcoin's production costs (i.e., mining cost) have no strong, direct effect on the bitcoin foreignexchange markets’ supply and demand forces. In a curious turn of events, the cost of mining a bitcoinhas virtually no impact on its price. Instead, causation is reversed, with increases (decreases) in bitcoin’sprice increasing (decreasing) miners’ costs.8 This result is consistent with Fantazinni and Kolodin (2020)and Kristoufek (2020), whose econometric studies find that “in the long run, mining costs strongly reactto the increase in bitcoin’s price and eventually catch up.”AcknowledgementsWe wish to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive suggestions.BibliographyAbraham, J., Higdon, D., Nelson, J., & Ibarra, J.

We anticipate this will continue at least until 2028, when the bitcoinreward will be BTC 1.5625, which at current prices is worth more than $90,000 and far in excess of transactionsfees. When new bitcoin creation stops or becomes sufficiently low, the cause and effect relationship we point outwill end.
